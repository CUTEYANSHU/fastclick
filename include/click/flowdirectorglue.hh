/**
 * Build instructions for gluing with DPDK.
 *
 * Direct connection with DPDK:
 * We need the following source files from DPDK:
 * \-> app/test-pmd/cmdline.c
 *     Contains object list of instructions cmdline_parse_ctx_t main_ctx[].
 *     This object must be used as 1st argument in cmdline_new below.
 *     To do so, we can write a simple getter as follows:
 *     cmdline_parse_ctx_t *main_ctx = cmdline_get_ctx();
 *     and then call cmdline_new(main_ctx, ...) as I do in
 *     flow_parser_alloc() (in lib/flowdirectorparser.cc)
 * \-> lib/librte_cmdline/cmdline.c
 *     Provides cmdline_new(main_ctx, ...)
 *     Returns a parser (struct cmdline *) instance
 *     Given that we got main_ctx, this is trivial call.
 * |-> lib/librte_cmdline/cmdline_parse.c
 *     Provides cmdline_parse(cl, input_cmd)
 *     Uses the parser instance (struct cmdline *) returned by
 *     cmdline_new() above.
